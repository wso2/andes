/**

 *
 * Extends the OnMessage AcknowledgeTests to validate that after the client has
 * failed over that the client can still receive and ack messages.
 *
 * All the AcknowledgeTest ack modes are exercised here though some are disabled
 * due to know issues (e.g. DupsOk, AutoAck : QPID-143 and the clientAck
 * and dirtyClientAck due to QPID-1816)
 *
 * This class has two main test structures, overrides of AcknowledgeOnMessageTest
 * to perform the clean acking based on session ack mode and a series of dirty
 * ack tests that test what happends if you receive a message then try and ack
 * AFTER you have failed over.

/**
 * Test DeapQueueConsumerWithSelector
 * Summary:
 * Prior to M4 the broker had a different queue model which pre-processed the
 * messages on the queue for any connecting subscription that had a selector.
 *
 * If the queue had a lot of data then this may take a long time to process
 * to such an extent that the subscription creation may time out. During this
 * pre-process phase the virtualhost would be come unresposive.
 *
 * Our solution was to allow the timeout to be adjusted QPID-1119, which allowed
 * the subscription to connect but did not address the unresponsiveness.
 *
 * The new queue model introduced in M4 resolved this.
 *
 * This test is to validate that the new queueing model does indeed remove the
 * long pre-processing phase and allow immediate subscription so that there is
 * no unresponsive period.
 *
 * Test Strategy:
 *
 * Add 100k messages to the queue with a numberic header property that will
 * allow later subscribers to use as in a selector.
 *
 * Connect the subscriber and time how long it takes to connect.
 *
 * Finally consume all the messages from the queue to clean up.

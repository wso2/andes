/**
 * QPID-1791
 *
 * The threading model in the Java broker (at least till 0.5) allows for the
 * close to be handled immediately even if the broker is still processing state
 * for that Session.
 *
 * This test verifys that QPID-1791 is has been handled.
 *
 * The problem was that the whilst the Session is busy processing Acks from the
 * client the Close frame jumps in and clears the unAcknowledgeMap in an
 * attempt to start processing them for closing the connection.
 *
 * If the session had a consumer consuming from a temporary queue. The closing
 * thread dequeues and deletes the message that were on the uncknowledgedMap.
 *
 * However, the Acking thread currently does:
 * queuEntry = unackedMap.get(messageID)
 *
 * dequeueAndDelete(queueEntry)
 *
 * unackedMap.remove(messageID)
 *
 * As a result the queueEntry is sitting in the unackedMap whilst it is being
 * dequeuedAndDeleted which leaves the opportunity for the close thread to
 * remove contents of the unackedMap for processing. The close thread will then
 * dequeueAndDelete all these values one of which the acking thread is currently
 * processing.
 *
 *
 * Test Approach
 *
 * Send a lot of persistent messages (5000), the goal of which is to fill the
 * pretch and to provide the broker with a lot of acks to process
 *
 * Using client ack and prefetch buffer of 5000 use receive to get 2500
 * Use AMQMessage.acknowledgeThis() to send a single ack frame back to the
 * broker per message so 2500 ack frames.
 * This will give the broker a lot to process,
 * Immediately send the consumer close after the acks are all gone.
 * This will cause the remaining 2500 prefetched messages plus any that have
 * not yet had their acks processed
 * to be collected by the requeue() process potentially

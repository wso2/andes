/**
 *
 * An {@link UncaughtExceptionHandler} that writes the exception to the application log via
 * the SLF4J framework.  Once registered with {@link Thread#setUncaughtExceptionHandler(UncaughtExceptionHandler)}
 * it will be invoked by the JVM when a thread has been <i>abruptly</i> terminated due to an uncaught exception.
 * Owing to the contract of {@link Runnable#run()}, the only possible exception types which can cause such a termination
 * are instances of {@link RuntimeException} and {@link Error}.  These exceptions are catastrophic and the client must
 * restart the JVM.
 * <p>
 * The implementation also invokes {@link ThreadGroup#uncaughtException(Thread, Throwable)}.  This
 * is done to retain compatibility with any monitoring solutions (for example, log scraping of
 * standard error) that existing users of older Qpid client libraries may have in place.

/**
 * A Job is a continuation that batches together other continuations, specifically {@link Event}s, into one continuation.
 * The {@link Event}s themselves provide methods to process themselves, so processing a job simply consists of sequentially
 * processing all of its aggregated events.
 *
 * The constructor accepts a maximum number of events for the job, and only runs up to that maximum number when
 * processing the job, but the add method does not enforce this maximum. In other words, not all the enqueued events
 * may be processed in each run of the job, several runs may be required to clear the queue.
 *
 * <p/><table id="crc"><caption>CRC Card</caption>
 * <tr><th> Responsibilities <th> Collaborations
 * <tr><td> Aggregate many coninuations together into a single continuation.
 * <tr><td> Sequentially process aggregated continuations. <td> {@link Event}
 * <tr><td> Provide running and completion status of the aggregate continuation.
 * <tr><td> Execute a terminal continuation upon job completion. <td> {@link JobCompletionHandler}
 * </table>
 *
 * @todo Could make Job implement Runnable, FutureTask, or a custom Continuation interface, to clarify its status as a
 *       continuation. Job is a continuation that aggregates other continuations and as such is a usefull re-usable
 *       piece of code. There may be other palces than the mina filter chain where continuation batching is used within
 *       qpid, so abstracting this out could provide a usefull building block. This also opens the way to different
 *       kinds of job with a common interface, e.g. parallel or sequential jobs etc.
 *
 * @todo For better re-usability could make the completion handler optional. Only run it when one is set.

/**
 * Test : CurrentActorTest
 * Summary:
 * Validate ThreadLocal operation.
 *
 * Test creates THREADS number of threads which all then execute the same test
 * together ( as close as looping Thread.start() will allow).
 *
 * Test:
 * Test sets the CurrentActor then proceeds to retrieve the value and use it.
 *
 * The test also validates that it is the same LogActor that this thread set.
 *
 * Finally the LogActor is removed and tested to make sure that it was
 * successfully removed.
 *
 * By having a higher number of threads than would normally be used in the
 * Poolling filter we aim to catch the race condition where a ThreadLocal remove
 * is called before one or more threads call get(). This way we can ensure that
 * the remove does not affect more than the Thread it was called in.

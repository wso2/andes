/**
 * Generate Message ids based on the TimeStamp.
 * <p/>
 * Here to preserve the long range we use a time stamp that is created by getting difference between
 * System.currentTimeMillis() and a configured reference time. Reference time can be configured.
 * <p/>
 * Message Id will created by appending time stamp , selected unique id for the node and two digit sequence number
 * <p/>
 * <time stamp> + <selected unique id for the node> + <seq number>
 * <p/>
 * sequence number is used in a scenario when two or more messages comes with same timestamp
 * (within the same millisecond). So to allow message rages higher than 1000 msg/s we use this sequence number
 * where it will be incremented in case of message comes in same millisecond within the same node. With this approach
 * We can go up to 100,000 msg/s

/**
 * The CurrentActor is a ThreadLocal wrapper that allows threads in the broker
 * to retrieve an actor to perform logging. This approach is used so for two
 * reasons:
 * 1) We do not have to pass a logging actor around the system
 * 2) We can set new actors at the point we have enough information. i.e.
 * - Set a low level ConnectionActor when processing bytes from the wire.
 * - Set a ChannelActor when we are processing the frame
 * - Set a SubscriptionActor when we are handling the subscription.
 * <p/>
 * The code performing the logging need not worry about what type of actor is
 * currently set so can perform its logging. The resulting log entry though will
 * contain customised details from the the currently set Actor.
 * <p/>
 * The Actor model also allows the pre-creation of fixed messages so the
 * performance impact of the additional logging data is minimised.
 * <p/>
 * This class does not perform any checks to ensure that there is an Actor set
 * when calling remove or get. As a result the application developer must ensure
 * that they have called set before they attempt to use the actor via get or
 * remove the set actor.
 * <p/>
 * The checking of the return via get should not be done as the logging is
 * desired. It is preferable to cause the NullPointerException to highlight the
 * programming error rather than miss a log message.
 * <p/>
 * The same is true for the remove. A NPE will occur if no set has been called
 * highlighting the programming error.
